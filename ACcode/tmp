I think the reason for piracy is that consumers have no copyright awareness.
Many consumers buy the purpose of satisfying their own needs and will not pay attention to whether it is genuine. Many people have a shallow legal awareness. They don't know that copying, translation, etc. need to be approved by the copyright owner. Otherwise, it is an infringement. Therefore, the lack of consumer copyright awareness is also one of the reasons for piracy.
